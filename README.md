# Text to Slang
Translate normal text to slang.

## Project Set-up
In addition to the required libraries mentioned in the [reqiurements.txt](https://github.com/basilnajjar/Text-to-Slang/blob/master/requirements.txt) file, you will need to download an appropriate version of ChromeDriver that is compatible with your Chrome's version.

## Example 
- [This](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/13/doe-investigation-foreign-governments/) is what an original article might look like.
- [This](https://github.com/basilnajjar/Text-to-Slang/blob/master/output.txt) is how it would look like if you run the program.
